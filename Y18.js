		about: "Indian institute of Technology Kanpur, being one of the premier institutes in India has had no scarcity of brilliant minds. I believe that for them to work at their level best, they need a proper bridge to convey their needs to the administration! I am a person with a curious mind and great enthusiasm to find answers. I have been a part of the senate, AnC council, MnC council, and Counselling Service, and by showing utmost diligence in every field, I have always tried to give justice to all the responsibilities. I can assure you that I will never get hesitant in stepping out of my comfort zone and setting things right! You will find me being among the most random groups ever, doing absolutely random things and probably be amazed by the gigantic amount of energy I have. I love to listen to people and make active efforts to help them when in need. I care a lot about the student body in IIT Kanpur and having had the opportunities to represent it, I'm looking forward to doing the best in future as well!",

The experience was enriching, as I observed that all members vehemently follow rules and procedures and a strict system of checks and balances was imposed on the executives in most of their actions. I want to preserve this sacrosanct stature of the senate, particularly in the eyes of the executives. Change is inevitable in these times, however my aim as a senator would be to attempt to preserve and elevate the relevance of the senate, and ensure that the check on executives is maintained at all times.",

I helped founding the Hall Executive Committee and took the initiative to solve the issues faced by the students. I want to give a platform to concerns of all, rather than a few so that we can reach an efficient resolution in a timely manner. I believe in myself and my fellow mates to bring about a change in the status quo.",

Talking about myself, I am a third year undergraduate student of Mechanical Engineering, with a firm conviction that it is vital for a representative to be able to unequivocally voice the grievances, concerns and be cognizant of the ongoing issues with the campus community. Having worked as a senator( BT/BS Y18 2020-21), manager of UG Academics (AnC council), and the DUGC nominee of ME, I have realized that Individual efforts can bring excellence but only collective efforts can deliver effectively. I believe, problems and issues are around us, and students have to be the active community gauging the concerns and be the change makers. I assert, it's not an individual matter about any of the candidates, it's about us, the campus community, and ideas need to flourish, ought to reach the floor, irrespective of who is at the face of medium. I envision the students of our campus thriving in years to come, when everyone would be the Picasso of their own canvas.",
